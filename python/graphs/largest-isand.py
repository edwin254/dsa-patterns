# You are given a 2D map of integers where each cell is 0 or 1 â€“ 1 representing a landmass and 0 representing water. 
# Landmasses are only connected in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). 
# Find the area of the largest island. Note that any water bodies (lakes) surrounded by landmass are included in the area of the island. 
    # 1 1 1 1 0

    # 0 0 0 0 0 
    # 1 1 0 0 1 
    # 0 0 0 0 0
